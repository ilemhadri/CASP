# CASP
Recently, bioscientists have developed new protein structures through computer simulations. Within the CASP Project, one important area of research is to find which of these simulated structures, if any, can be found in natural environments. We use hierarchical clustering and classification techniques to assess large numbers of protein structures. 
<br />Finally, I implemented parallel versions of the C++ algorithms using the MPI interface. 
<br />**Note :** Due to the specific manipulations on protein files, there is no *makefile*. Refer to the file *Lisezmoi.txt* instead.
